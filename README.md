All these problem solutions are implemented in C or C++ using pthreads. 

The problems include:
  1. Dining Philosophers' problem
  2. DIning Savages' problem
  3. Producer Consumer problem with cyclic buffer
  4. Producer Consumer problem with infinite buffer
  5. Producer Consumer problem with bounded buffer
  6. Building H2O problem
  7. Cigarette Smokers' problem
  8. Readers' Writer's problem
  9. Sleeping Barber problem.
